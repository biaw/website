# New website!

Welcome to the new website! We're trying out a new design, it's still very empty in here but we plan on adding more stuff soon.

I've also decided to include this blog so all our members (including me) can write blog posts about whatever we want. I'm planning on writing about my experience with stuff and what I've learned so far.

## What the future brings

This will be a good new start of Promise Solutions. We will revisit some older projects and rework some of our newer ones. Just so it's all fresh.

Our goal with Promise Solutions is to create projects that are useful to us, and also maybe you. We want to create projects that we can be proud of, and that we can teach others from. It's all about learning and having fun.

I'm excited to see what the future brings, and I hope you are too!
